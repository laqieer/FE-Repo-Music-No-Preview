The files in this directory are specifcally formatted for FE7 but can easily be converted to FE8.
The following songs will require you insert the sample given to instrument number 25
	-Across the Horizon
	-The Beautiful Wasteland
	-The Enemy of the Wasteland

As you can see, most of these songs were hand written by me. Since these files were recieved for no charge, I ask that if you use my composed songs, to give credit to Tamborrino (me). Thanks in advance
